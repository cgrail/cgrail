# Hey ðŸ‘‹

my name is Christian Grail and I'm a staff developer at SAP in Germany. I enjoy building stuff that is used and helps people.

Here on GitHub I'm a core maintainer and reviewer of the open-source and crowd-sourced project [tech-conferences/conference-data](https://github.com/tech-conferences/conference-data) which is published to the website [www.confs.tech](https://confs.tech/)

At SAP I work on projects like:
- [SAP Inscribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kICnfrqOizw) a handwriting and machine learning based conversational digital assistant
- [SAP BUILD](https://vimeo.com/182832619) a complete set of cloud-based tools to design and build enterprise apps
- [SAP Data Encounter](https://sapvideoa35699dc5.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=0_mdjdr8rn) an award winning 3D Big Data exploration tool which utilizes AR and VR
  
I'm a frequent speaker at conferences around the world for topics like augmented reality and open source. A list of my talks can be found on my site [grails.de](https://grails.de/about)
